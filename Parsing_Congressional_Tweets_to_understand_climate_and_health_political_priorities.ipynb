        "Social media use by public servants and congress in particular has exploded recently. The one major benefit of members of congress using social media is it has cut down on the [transaction costs](https://fcw.com/articles/2018/08/08/social-media-congress.aspx) required to communicate directly with their constituents. Social media use is now at a point where nearly every member of Congress is using it to advance their platform in one way or another. Interestingly enough, however, is the fact that social media interaction varies between parties. A recent report by [PEW](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/07/16/congress-soars-to-new-heights-on-social-media/) demonstrated that while Democratic lawmakers are more apt to post on social media -- Republican lawmakers receive more engagement on their posts. This could signify that more is not necessarily better as Republican's may be getting a better ROI (Return on their investment) relative to the amount they are posting. Perhaps there is even some [hypocrisy](https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-members-social-media-records-analysis-2021-1) amongst lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who increasingly attack and confront big tech social media companies but yet are both posting more than ever on the respective platforms! Perhaps that is why lawmakers haven't necessarily targeted Twitter like they have Facebook -- because Twitter is by far the most popular platform to use amongst members of Congress. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another benefit of social media is it increasingly allows old lawmakers to [target younger audiences](https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-members-social-media-records-analysis-2021-1) -- who are becoming more and more crucial in elections these days. In fact, social media use proved crucial for the election of President Joe Biden as it [allowed him to reach](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2020/11/17/social-media-proved-crucial-for-joe-biden--it-allowed-him-to-connect-with-young-voters-and-avoid-his-infamous-gaffes/?sh=6e23fe1a4148) younger voters who he traditionally was not heavily associated with. However, social media use among politicians also can pose dangers. For instance, for politicians that want to cause harm to please a certain base of voters -- social media offers a ripe platform to spread disinformation and misinformation campaigns along with promote loony [conspiracy theories](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/why-social-media-ruining-political-discourse/589108/). These dangerous conspiracies being promoted as of recent threaten to destroy the very fabric of our beloved democracy. Meanwhile, this isn't a one sided feeling however. Both sides of the aisle feel that social media is increasingly [harming the country](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/15/64-of-americans-say-social-media-have-a-mostly-negative-effect-on-the-way-things-are-going-in-the-u-s-today/) along with the political climate. Perhaps citizens are feeling this way because [anti-system/anti-party candidates](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2017/04/28/why-are-populists-winning-online-social-media-reinforces-their-anti-establishment-message/) are the types of politicians who continue to use social media to their advantage while eroding the vertical linkages that traditionally stabilized democratic politics. At the end of the day, social media use amongst politicians and public servants has its advantages as it can create stronger linkages with voters while cutting down on the transaction costs required to reach such voters. However, social media use can also be used by politicians to harm democracy while promoting harmful conspiracy theories. In the end, the pros must be weighed against the cons -- social media use amongst public servants is not perfect -- but with the right protections in place, it can be a useful tool while also helping members of Congress to more easily communicate with their constituents.

        "**Figure 5:** Figure 5 above plots the total # of Delta variant mentions of the Coronavirus pandemic by members of Congress throughout the summer of 2021. The x-axis represents the date and is in ascending order from the beginning of June 2021 on the far left end of the x-axis to the end of August 2021 on the far right end of the x-axis. For those dates (Month-Days) that are not listed across the x-axis signifies that there were 0 mentions of Delta variant on that respective day. The y-axis shows the total # of Delta variant mentions at a range of roughly 0 mentions to 37 total daily mentions. Overall, this plot in figure 5 referencing total count of Delta variant mentions amongst Congresspersons [does not necessarily match and or track the actual level of positive COVID tests during this time](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) as positive cases really began to explode upward towards the end of August while the total highest number of delta variant mentions by congresspersons in summer 2021 according to figure 5 occurred on the day July 8th. However, it is important to notice that there is more 'activity' or 'density' so to say in figure 5 as we near the end of August on the x-axis for total mentions of the delta variant by congresspersons in summer 2021"

        "In the end, there were several core assumptions that went into the analyses we have presented above. The most important one and the one that is nearly all inclusive -- is that for each subset of a dataframe I created to answer specific research questions via boolean indexing to only retrieve data that contained a specific word or phrase --> that indexing was all inclusive. This means that it didn't matter the context --> if the word such as 'Delta' was used in a tweet --> it counted as being a part of a new dataframe that only contained tweets with the mentioning of the word 'Delta'. Also, one other core assumption was in this case throughout the various analyses presneted above -- I treated the data as independent ie it was not correlated from one observation to the next or over time. Thus, plotting the daily # of tweets throughout summer of 2021 entailed ensuring each respective day was its own unique set of data. Overall, this anlayses proved highly robust and we have demonstrated thoroughly that Democrats as a whole are more prolific tweets and they care more about issues relating to the pandemic and teacher safety.
